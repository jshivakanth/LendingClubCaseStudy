## General Information
This is a case study based on historic data from a consumer finance company which specialises in lending various types of loans to urban customers. When the company receives a loan application, the company has to make a decision for loan approval based on the applicantâ€™s profile
The main objective is to be able to identify these risky loan applicants, then such loans can be reduced thereby cutting down the amount of credit loss. 
The overall obective of this case study is to perform an EDA to understand the driving factors behind loan default, i.e.the variables which are strong indicators of default. The company can utilise this knowledge for its portfolio and risk assessment.
